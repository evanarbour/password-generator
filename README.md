# Creating a Password Generator

This application was my first dive into using JavaScript with a clear goal:
create a password generator. I started the process of making the generator
by commenting in the .js file what the necessary steps are. I kept asking myself:
"what needs to happen next?" and would write that action in a comment line.

After writing most of the first couple actions, I would go and write the code
that executed the steps I laid out for myself. I kept working through this process until the final product was complete and I could make passwords!

Once I finished writing the javascript code, I styled via CSS. I wanted a clean,
professional look to the page with easy to read-text and user interaction. I decided to use checkboxes instead of window prompts because it's easier for the user to see which parameters they've put on their password and can more easily change it.
